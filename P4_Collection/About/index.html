					<p>These games, as with most of my Super Nintendo games, are ones I got from my aunt and uncle on my father's side. My memory of receiving them is fairly blurry, however, if what I remember is accurate, then I received these games and a Super Nintendo to play them on when I spent a week or two at my grandmother's house when my father needed open heart surgery. I suppose my family thought I could use the entertainment. I became instantly enraptured by these games, despite the apparently lack of quality many of them share.  </p>
					<p>As I grew older, revisiting these games started to become a partially surreal experience. With many of these are games, it should be all but impossible to have fun with them, however, I found myself consistently enjoying these games as unique experiences. On one side, I enjoyed the nostalgic value of revisiting them. On the other side, these games have a great comedy to them, should you be open to laugh at bad game design. </p>
