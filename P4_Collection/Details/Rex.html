					<p>Radical Rex, or Baby T-Rex on the Game Boy in Europe, is an action platformer for the Sega Genesis, the Sega CD, the Nintendo Game Boy, and the SNES. Radical Rex features a totally gnarly T-Rex named Radical Rex who skateboards, breathes fire, and otherwise platforms his way through a pre-historic land to save his girlfriend, Rexanne, from the evil magician Sethron. Sethron is replaced by a weasel-like mammal named Skriitch in the Sega Genesis and Sega CD versions. Despite this, the weasel acts the same as its Super NES Counterpart.</p>

					<p>Rex has a few abilities, including a roar that kills or hurts all enemies on screen, a fire breath which can temporarily immobilize enemies, and a bubble spray which he can use while under water. At many designated points throughout the game, Rex can jump onto a skateboard to zoom around like the faster segments of a Sonic the Hedgehog title. This game is worth checking out for the comedic value of its "Nineties attitude." It seems to attempt to emulate Sonic the Hedgehog and Super Mario Brothers simultaneously, relying very heavily on what corporate higher-ups thought the kids of the day saw as cool instead of polishing a product worth playing by its own merit - this practice was extremely common for several years in the 90s. </p>
