					<p>Toy Story, an obvious tie-in to Pixar's film of the same name. What makes this game interesting to me is its lack of focus and its confusing design. Sometimes this game is a pure platformer, sometimes it's a platformer with an action focus, sometimes it's a platformer with puzzles, sometimes it's an RC car racer, so on and so on. I would argue that this lack of focus is likely to blame for the lack of polish in the controls, the level designs, the story presentation, et cetera. This diversity, however, was also a primary marketing point for the title, and it may have helped to sell many of the copies this game sold.</p>

					<p>The plot of this game follows the plot of the Toy Story film with a few minor differences, which is bound to happen when adapting a full film to a Super Nintendo game. Players control Woody through 17 levels (this count varies by console,) which encompasses the plot - each stage represents some part of the story via parallels between the gameplay and the environments with the film's scene. For example, one level has the player controlling RC (or Woody controlling RC with the controller in-game,) and another features gameplay where you rescue green army men toys so they can set-up a baby monitor so the toys can listen-in on Andy's birthday party. </p>
