					<p>The Wizard of Oz, released exclusively for the Super Nintendo in 1993, is loosely based on the 1939 film of the same name. It was developed by Manley & Associates and published by SETA Corporation - god knows why. The player takes control of Dorothy and her friends with the goal of defeating the Wicked Witch of the West, who is trying to take Dorothy's ruby slippers.</p>

					<p>The strangest aspect of this game, to me, is its insistence to take Dorothy to locations not found in the film nor in the book despite the wealth of interesting, iconic set pieces at their disposal. The game features levels that take place in the Shy Village, Gamboge Gorge, Maize Meadow, Saffron Fields, Xanthin Farms, Citron City, The Red Country, and Cinnabar City, but it lacks the Emerald City and the poppy fields.</p>
