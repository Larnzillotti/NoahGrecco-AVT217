					<p>This game's title is inconsistent at best. The title screen reads as "Beethoven's 2nd," the box art tells us that it's called "Beethoven: The Ultimate Canine Caper;" plenty of sources refer to it as a combination of the two names: "Beethoven's 2nd: The Ultiamte Canine Caper." This game's lack of a page on Wikipedia doesn't do anything to help clear-up the confusion, but I personally find it amusing.</p>

					<p>This game is based on the 1993 movie called Beethoven's 2nd. It is possible that the title screen reads as "Beethoven's 2nd" because they ripped the image from the movie's poster/VHS box art image. The player takes control of a large St. Bernard dog in a simulation-esque platformer where all of the playable character's abilities are based on common dog behavior, such as shaking off water for an area-of-effect attack or barking to scare-off enemies.</p>
