					<p>X-Kaliber 2097's American soundtrack was created by electronic music group Psykosonik, which was an extremely prominent element of the game's marketing, including a spot on the front of the box art. Despite that fact, most people will instantly recognize the melody of the game's early music as the Mortal Kombat theme.</p>
					<p>The Japanese version of the game features music from Hitoshi Sakimoto and Hayato Matsuo, as well as an entirely different storyline and script for the characters. The game also goes by the name Sword Maniac in Japan.</p>

					<p>Researching further into the game's developers does not reveal much information. Fupac has released many games, however, very few of them have broken into the US market. The two other games of theirs that made it to the United States are Project Sylpheed: Arc of Deception on the Xbox 360 and Lumines Plus for the PlayStation 2. That being said, they are not the designers of these games, but programmers. I was entirely unsuccessful in learning anything about Winds, the game's other developing studio.</p>
