					<p>The Addams Family was released on a total of six different console as a tie-in product to the 1991 movie of the same name. This product was released for the Master System, the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, the Super Nintendo, the Amiga, the Atari ST, and the TurboGrafx-16, all of which were developed by Ocean Software. I can't help but wonder if the sheer number of consoles they released for contributed to the game's lack of polish. The game was followed-up with Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt in 1993, based on the Addams Family animated series, as well Addams Family Values in 1995, a sequel based on the film of the same name.</p>

					<p>The game's story, which the player must read the manual to access, follows Gomez Addams, the family's father, as he explores various areas of their mansion in an attempt to save his family. The Addams Family's lawyer, Tully Alford, took control of the mansion and imprisoned five members of the family: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny, and Uncle Fester.</p>

					<p>The game's reviews are incredibly mixed, as are my feelings for the game. The Amiga and Super Nintendo versions of the game have scores as high as 95% from back in the day, while the NES and Gameboy versions were received less favorably. Mega, who scored the game at 25%, commented that readers should "Watch a tree grow or something instead."</p>
