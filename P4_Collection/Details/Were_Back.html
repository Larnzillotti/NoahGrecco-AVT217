					<p>We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story is a platformer based on the 1993 Universal Pictures movie. This game was released on the Nintendo Game Boy, the Sega Genesis, PCs, and the SNES. The player controls an intelligent T-Rex through various city-themed levels filled with obstacles and enemies. Rex, the playable character, can toss small rocks at enemies to defeat them as opposed to biting them or swinging at them with his tail. At any time, the player can call for help from the other dinosaurs featured in the film with mixed, confusing, seemingly random results for those without the manual like myself. </p>

					<p>The funniest elements of this game are in its presentation. The playable character is far too large for the screen's dimentions, the camera swings wildly every time the player turns them around, the music is awkwardly produced, and the controls feel like learning to drive for the first time. I wish I could offer more information, but the internet is all but devoid of resources on the subject. </p>
