					<h2 href ="Details/x-kaluber.html">X-Kaliber 2097 (February, 1994)</h2>
					<p>Released as "Sword Maniac" (S≈çdo Maniakku) in Japan, X-Kaliber 2097 is a side-scrolling action platformer, comparable to Castlevania in some ways. Unlike Castlevania, this game features odd floaty controls, strange difficulty slopes, and an all-around lack of content, even for 1994. That being said, I would recommend trying it for a good laugh thanks largely in part to its nineties-future aesthetic, featuring neon cityscapes and a "Hot tekno soundtrack by Psykosonik," as advertised on certain releases of the game's box art.</p>

					<h2>King of the Monsters (1991)</h2>
					<p>King of Monsters is a fighting/wrestling game originally released by SNK on July 1, 1991 in Japan with Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis ports coming shortly thereafter. This game's roster of playable character features giant monsters inspired by Tokusatsu and Kaiju characters, such as Godzilla and Ultraman. While entertaining in style, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. Combat consists of tedious loops of punches, kicks, lasers, and grapples until one player is arbitrarily named the winner by countdown.</p>

					<h2>The Addams Family (1992)</h2>
					<p>Based on the 1991 film of the same name, The Addams Family is a platformer where players control Gomez Addams as he attempts to rescue his family from their imprisonment. This game makes this list in part because of how disappointing it is. This game is incredibly close in many ways to offering a very enjoyable experience, but it all falls short in the end. Unlike many of its contemporaries, such as Super Mario World, The Addams Family is an open-world game that invites players to explore the Addams's mansion. Sadly, broken controls and foul level and enemy design keep this game from being the cult classic it could have been.</p>

					<h2>The Pagemaster (1994)</h2>
					<p>The Pagemaster, from Probe Software Ltd. and Fox Interactive, was released in conjunction with the Macaulay Culkin film of the same name from 20th Century Fox. The game received a mixed reception upon release; GamePro sited its inaccurate controls and generally repetitive-feeling gameplay. The game has a redundant feel thanks to the constant need to its uninspired platform jumping against the same enemies over and over again. This game is worth playing for the comedy value inherent to any movie tie-in video game.</p>

					<h2>Beethoven: The Ultimate Canine Caper (December, 1993)</h2>
					<p>Beethoven: The Ultimate Canine Caper! is a strange game. Developed by Rozner Labs Software Group, Riedel Software Productions, Inc. and Unexpected Development (certainly all household names the likes of Nintendo and Sega,) this platformer looks to give kids the opportunity to roleplay as the titual canine as he wanders around town looking for his lost puppies. What makes this game funny is the general grudge reality itself seems to hold against this St. Bernard. Anything from park squirrels teenagers on skateboards to small drops of water and neighborhood street lamps hurt the protagonist on contact, and are deadset on doing just that.</p>

					<h2>Toy Story (December, 1995)</h2>
					<p>Toy Story is a side-scrolling platformer created by Traveller's Tales as a tie-in product to accompany the release of the Disney film of the same name. This game tries to offer variety by making nearly every level drastically different, but the experience the player is left with is an unpolished mess that doesn't excel at anything in particular. This title excels at confusing the player, but at the very least, it's consistently funny thanks to the unbridled strangeness featuring such familiar, beloved characters.</p>

					<h2>We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story (November, 1993)</h2>
					<p>This game doesn't have a Wikipedia page whatsoever. That's typically indicative of something. We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story is a platformer from Visual Concepts, the lesser-known creator of other infamous SNES games like ClayFighter and Lester the Unlikely, both of which would make this list if I owned them. Every aspect of this game's controls are uncomfortable and the gameplay is practically un-designed, but the culmination of the music and visuals is positively hilarious and worth witnessing for sheer comedy's sake. For example, the game's main theme features a strange sample of a man's laugh, and the main playable character looks like a block of maroilles cheese.</p>

					<h2>The Wizard of Oz (1993)</h2>
					<p>It's hard to say what, precisely, drove developers in the early nineties to create a game based on a 1939 classic film, but here you have it. The game is a platformer, not that most first-time players could tell amongst the non-functional collisions and equally broken controls. I adore playing bad games for a laugh, but this one can't even make me smile.</p>
