<ol>“What can I do for you, my dwarves?” he
said.</ol>
<ol>“Kili at your service!” said the one. “And
Fili!” added the other; and they both swept off
their blue hoods and bowed.</ol>
<ol>“At yours and your family’s!” replied Bilbo,
remembering his manners this time.</ol>
<ol>“Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,” said
Kili. “Let us join the throng!”</ol>
<ol>“Throng!” thought Mr. Baggins. “I don’t like
the sound of that. I really must sit down for a
minute and collect my wits, and have a drink.”
He had only just had a sip—in the corner, while
the four dwarves sat round the table, and talked
about mines and gold and troubles with the
goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and
lots of other things which he did not understand,
and did not want to, for they sounded much too
adventurous—when, ding-dong-a-ling-dang,
his bell rang again, as if some naughty little
hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off.</ol>
<ol>“Someone at the door!” he said, blinking.</ol>
<ol>“Some four, I should say by the sound,” said
Fili. “Besides, we saw them coming along
behind us in the distance.”</ol>
<ol>The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall
and put his head in his hands, and wondered
what had happened, and what was going to
happen, and whether they would all stay to
supper. Then the bell rang again louder than
ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not
four after all, it was five. Another dwarf had
come along while he was wondering in the hall.
He had hardly turned the knob, before they were
all inside, bowing and saying “at your service”
one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin
were their names; and very soon two purple
hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white
hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they
marched with their broad hands stuck in their
gold and silver belts to join the others.Already it
had almost become a throng. Some called for
ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee,
and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was
kept very busy for a while.</ol>
<ol>A big jug of coffee had just been set in the
hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the
dwarves were starting on a round of buttered
scones, when there came—a loud knock. Not a
ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit’s beautiful
green door. Somebody was banging with a
stick!</ol>
<ol>Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry,
and altogether bewildered and bewuthered—
this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever
remembered. He pulled open the door with a
jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other.
More dwarves, four more! And there was
Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and
laughing. He had made quite a dent on the
beautiful door; he had also, by the way,
knocked out the secret mark that he had put
there the morning before.</ol>
