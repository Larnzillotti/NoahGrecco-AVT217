<ol>“Carefully! Carefully!” he said. “It is not like
you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat,
and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me
introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially
Thorin!”</ol>
<ol>“At your service!” said Bifur, Bofur, and
Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up
two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and
also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel.
This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously
important dwarf, in fact no other than the great
Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all
pleased at falling flat on Bilbo’s mat with Bifur,
Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing
Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin
indeed was very haughty, and said nothing
about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he
was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted
“pray don’t mention it,” and stopped frowning.</ol>
<ol>“Now we are all here!” said Gandalf, looking
at the row of thirteen hoods—the best
detachable party hoods—and his own hat
hanging on the pegs. “Quite a merry gathering! I
hope there is something left for the late-comers
to eat and drink! What’s that? Tea! No thank
you! A little red wine, I think for me.”</ol>
<ol>“And for me,” said Thorin.</ol>
<ol>“And raspberry jam and apple-tart,” said
Bifur.</ol>
<ol>“And mince-pies and cheese,” said Bofur.</ol>
<ol>“And pork-pie and salad,” said Bombur.</ol>
<ol>“And more cakes—and ale—and coffee, if
you don’t mind,” called the other dwarves
through the door.</ol>
<ol>“Put on a few eggs, there’s a good fellow!”
Gandalf called after him, as the hobbit stumped
off to the pantries. “And just bring out the cold
chicken and pickles!”</ol>
<ol>“Seems to know as much about the inside
of my larders as I do myself!” thought Mr.
Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed,
and was beginning to wonder whether a most
wretched adventure had not come right into his
house. By the time he had got all the bottles and
dishes and knives and forks and glasses and
plates and spoons and things piled up on big
trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the
face, and annoyed.</ol>
<ol>“Confusticate and bebother these
dwarves!” he said aloud. “Why don’t they come
and lend a hand?” Lo and behold! there stood
Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and
Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could
say knife they had whisked the trays and a
couple of small tables into the parlour and set
out everything afresh.</ol>
<ol>Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the
thirteen dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a
stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his
appetite was quite taken away), and trying to
look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not
in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and
ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At
last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo
made a move to collect the plates and glasses.</ol>
<ol>“I suppose you will all stay to supper?” he
said in his politest unpressing tones.</ol>
<ol>“Of course!” said Thorin. “And after. We
shan’t get through the business till late, and we
must have some music first. Now to clear <a href="page7.html">up!”</a></ol>
