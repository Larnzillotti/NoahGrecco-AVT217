<ol><a href = "../index.html">By some curious chance one morning long
ago in the quiet of the world, when there was
less noise and more green, and the hobbits
were still numerous and prosperous, and Bilbo
Baggins was standing at his door after
breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden
pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes
(neatly brushed)—Gandalf came by. Gandalf! If
you had heard only a quarter of what I have
heard about him, and I have only heard very little
of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for
any sort of remarkable tale. Tales and
adventures sprouted up all over the place
wherever he went, in the most extraordinary
fashion. He had not been down that way under
The Hill for ages and ages, not since his friend
the Old Took died, in fact, and the hobbits had
almost forgotten what he looked like. He had
been away over The Hill and across The Water
on businesses of his own since they were all
small hobbit-boys and hobbit-girls.</a></ol>
<ol>All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that
morning was an old man with a staff. He had a
tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver
scarf over which his long white beard hung
down below his waist, and immense black
boots.</ol>
<ol>“Good Morning!” said Bilbo, and he meant
it. The sun was shining, and the grass was very
green. But Gandalf looked at him from under
long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than
the brim of his shady hat.</ol>
<ol>“What do you mean?” he said. “Do you wish
me a good morning, or mean that it is a good
morning whether I want it or not; or that you feel
good this morning; or that it is a morning to be
good on?”</ol>
<ol>“All of them at once,” said Bilbo. “And a very
fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors,
into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you,
sit down and have a fill of mine! There’s no
hurry, we have all the day before us!” Then Bilbo
sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his
legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring of
smoke that sailed up into the air without
breaking and floated away over The Hill.</ol>
<ol>“Very pretty!” said Gandalf. “But I have no
time to blow smoke-rings this morning. I am
looking for someone to share in an adventure
that I am arranging, and it’s very difficult to find
anyone.”</ol>
<ol>“I should think so—in these parts! We are
plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures.
Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make
you late for dinner! I can’t think what anybody
sees in them,” said our Mr. Baggins, and stuck
one thumb behind his braces, and blew out
another even bigger smoke-ring. Then he took
out his morning letters, and began to read,
pretending to take no more notice of the old
man. He had decided that he was not quite his
sort, and wanted him to go away. But the old
man did not move. He stood leaning on his
stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying
anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and
even a little cross.</ol>
<ol>“Good morning!” he said at last. “We don’t
want any adventures here, thank you! You might
try over The Hill or across The Water.” By this
he meant that the conversation was at an end.
“What a lot of things you do use Good
morning for!” said Gandalf. “Now you mean that
you want to get rid of me, and that it won’t be
good till I move off.”</ol>
<ol>“Not at all, not at all, my dear sir! Let me
see, I don’t think I know your name?”</ol>
<ol>“Yes, yes, my dear sir—and I do know your
name, Mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my
name, though you don’t remember that I belong
to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me! To
think that I should have lived to be goodmorninged
by Belladonna Took’s son, as if I
was selling buttons at the door!”</ol>
<ol><a href = "page3.html">“Gandalf, Gandalf! Good gracious me! Not
the wandering wizard that gave Old Took a pair
of magic diamond studs that fastened
themselves and never came undone till
ordered? Not the fellow who used to tell such
wonderful tales at parties, about dragons and
goblins and giants and the rescue of
princesses and the unexpected luck of widows’
sons? Not the man that used to make such
particularly excellent fireworks! I remember
those! Old Took used to have them on
Midsummer’s Eve. Splendid! They used to go
up like great lilies and snapdragons and
laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all
evening!” You will notice already that Mr.
Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to
believe, also that he was very fond of flowers.
“Dear me!” he went on. “Not the Gandalf who
was responsible for so many quiet lads and
lasses going off into the Blue for mad
adventures? Anything from climbing trees to
visiting elves—or sailing in ships, sailing to
other shores! Bless me, life used to be quite
inter—I mean, you used to upset things badly in
these parts once upon a time. I beg your
pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business.”</a></ol>
