	<ol>As they sang the hobbit felt the love of
beautiful things made by hands and by cunning
and by magic moving through him, a fierce and
a jealous love, the desire of the hearts of
dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up
inside him, and he wished to go and see the
great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and
the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear
a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked
out of the window. The stars were out in a dark
sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of
the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly
in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up —probably somebody lighting a wood-fire—
and he thought of plundering dragons settling
on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He
shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr.
Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again.</ol>
<ol>He got up trembling. He had less than half a
mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a
mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the
beer-barrels in the cellar, and not come out
again until all the dwarves had gone away.
Suddenly he found that the music and the
singing had stopped, and they were all looking
at him with eyes shining in the dark.</ol>
<ol>“Where are you going?” said Thorin, in a
tone that seemed to show that he guessed both
halves of the hobbit’s mind.</ol>
<ol>“What about a little light?” said Bilbo
apologetically.</ol>
<ol>“We like the dark,” said all the dwarves.
“Dark for dark business! There are many hours
before dawn.”</ol>
<ol>“Of course!” said Bilbo, and sat down in a
hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender,
knocking over the poker and shovel with a
crash.</ol>
<ol>“Hush!” said Gandalf. “Let Thorin speak!”
And this is how Thorin began.</ol>
<ol>“Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We
are met together in the house of our friend and
fellow conspirator, this most excellent and
audacious hobbit—may the hair on his toes
never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!—”
He paused for breath and for a polite remark
from the hobbit, but the compliments were quite
lost on poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging
his mouth in protest at being called audacious
and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no
noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So
Thorin went on:</ol>
<ol>“We are met to discuss our plans, our ways,
means, policy and devices. We shall soon
before the break of day start on our long
journey, a journey from which some of us, or
perhaps all of us (except our friend and
counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may
never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object
is, I take it, well known to us all. To the
estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or
two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be
right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the
exact situation at the moment may require a
little brief explanation—”</ol>
<ol>This was Thorin’s style. He was an
important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he
would probably have gone on like this until he
was out of breath, without telling any one there
anything that was not known already. But he
was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn’t bear
it any longer. At may never return he began to
feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it
burst out like the whistle of an engine coming
out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang up,
knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue
light on the end of his magic staff, and in its
firework glare the poor little hobbit could be
seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a
jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the
floor, and kept on calling out “struck by lightning,
struck by lightning!” over and over again; and
that was all they could get out of him for a long
time. So they took him and laid him out of the
way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at
his elbow, and they went back to their dark
his elbow, and they went back to their dark
business.</ol>
<ol>“Excitable little fellow,” said Gandalf, as they
sat down again. “Gets funny queer fits, but he is
one of the best, one of the best—as fierce as a
dragon in a pinch.”</ol>
<ol>If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch,
you will realize that this was only poetical
exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old
Took’s great-grand-uncle Bullroarer, who was
so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a
horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of
Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields,
and knocked their king Golfimbul’s head clean
off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards
through the air and went down a rabbit-hole,
and in this way the battle was won and the
game of Golf invented at the same moment.</ol>
<ol>n the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer’s
gentler descendant was reviving in the drawingroom.
After a while and a drink he crept
nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what
he heard, Gloin speaking: “Humph!” (or some
snort more or less like that). “Will he do, do you
think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about
this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that
in a moment of excitement would be enough to
wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill
the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright
than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the
than excitement! In fact, if it had not been for the
sign on the door, I should have been sure we
had come to the wrong house. As soon as I
clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and
puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks
more like a grocer than a burglar!”</ol>
<ol>Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and
went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly
felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be
thought fierce. As for little fellowbobbing on the
mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a
time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what
he did now, and he said to himself: “Bilbo, you
were a fool; you walked right in and put your
foot in it.”</ol>
<ol>“Pardon me,” he said, “if I have overheard
words that you were saying. I don’t pretend to
understand what you are talking about, or your
reference to burglars, but I think I am right in
believing” (this is what he called being on his
dignity) “that you think I am no good. I will show
you. I have no signs on my door—it was painted
a week ago—, and I am quite sure you have
come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw
your funny faces on the door-step, I had my
doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me
what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to
walk from here to the East of East and fight the
wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I had a
great-great-great-grand-uncle once, Bullroarer
Took, and—”</ol>
<ol>“Yes, yes, but that was long ago,” said
Gloin. “Iwas talking about you. And I assure you
there is a mark on this door—the usual one in
the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good
job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable
Reward, that’s how it is usually read. You can
say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar
if you like. Some of them do. It’s all the same to
us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the
sort in these parts looking for a Job at once,
and that he had arranged for a meeting here
this Wednesday tea-time.”</ol>
<ol>“Of course there is a mark,” said Gandalf. “I
put it there myself. For very good reasons. You
asked me to find the fourteenth man for your
expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let
any one say I chose the wrong man or the
wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and
have all the bad luck you like, or go back to
digging coal.”</ol>
<ol>He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the
dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo
tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he
turned and frowned at him and stuck out his
bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight
with a snap. “That’s right,” said Gandalf. “Let’s
have no more argument. I have chosen Mr.
Baggins and that ought to be enough for all of
you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or
will be when the time comes. There is a lot
more in him than you guess, and a deal more
than he has any idea of himself. You may
(possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my
boy, fetch the lamp, and let’s have a little light
on this!”</ol>
<ol>On the table in the light of a big lamp with a
red shade he spread a piece of parchment
rather like a map.</ol>
<ol>“This was made by Thror, your grandfather,
Thorin,” he said in answer to the dwarves’
excited questions. “It is a plan of the Mountain.”</ol>
<ol>“I don’t see that this will help us much,” said
Thorin disappointedly after a glance. “I
remember the Mountain well enough and the
lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is,
and the Withered Heath where the great
dragons bred.”</ol>
<ol>“There is a dragon marked in red on the
Mountain,” said Balin, “but it will be easy
enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive
there.”</ol>
<ol>“There is one point that you haven’t
noticed,” said the wizard, “and that is the secret
entrance. You see that rune on the West side,
and the hand pointing to it from the other runes?
That marks a hidden passage to the Lower
Halls.” (Look at the map at the beginning of this
book, and you will see there the runes.)</ol>
<ol>“It may have been secret once,” said Thorin,
“but how do we know that it is secret any
longer? Old Smaug has lived there long enough
now to find out anything there is to know about
those caves.”</ol>
<ol>“He may—but he can’t have used it for
years and years.”</ol>
<ol>"Why?"</ol>
<ol>“Because it is too small. ‘Five feet high the
door and three may walk abreast’ say the
runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole
that size, not even when he was a young
dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of
the dwarves and men of Dale.”</ol>
<ol>“It seems a great big hole to me,” squeaked
Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and
only of hobbit-holes). He was getting excited
and interested again, so that he forgot to keep
his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall
there hung a large one of the Country Round
with all his favourite walks marked on it in red
ink. “How could such a large door be kept
secret from everybody outside, apart from the
dragon?” he asked. He was only a little hobbit
you must remember.</ol>
<ol>“In lots of ways,” said Gandalf. “But in what
way this one has been hidden we don’t know
without going to see. From what it says on the
map I should guess there is a closed door
which has been made to look exactly like the
side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves’
method—I think that is right, isn’t it?”</ol>
<ol>“Quite right,” said Thorin.</ol>
<ol>“Also,” went on Gandalf, “I forgot to mention
that with the map went a key, a small and
curious key. Here it is!” he said, and handed to
Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate
wards, made of silver. “Keep it safe!”</ol>
