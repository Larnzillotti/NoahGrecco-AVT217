	<ol>The dark filled all the room, and the fire died
down, and the shadows were lost, and still they
played on. And suddenly first one and then
another began to sing as they played, deepthroated
singing of the dwarves in the deep
places of their ancient homes; and this is like a
fragment of their song, if it can be like their
song without their music.</ol>

<ol class = "i">Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class = "i">The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollowhalls beneath the fells.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class="i">For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they
caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class="i">On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class="i">Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class="i">Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class="i">The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class="i">The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragonâ€™s ire more fierce than fire
Laid lowtheir towers and houses frail.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class = "i">The mountain smoked beneath the
moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of
doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.</ol>
<ol></ol>
<ol class = "i">Far over the misty mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day,
To win our harps and gold from him!</ol>
