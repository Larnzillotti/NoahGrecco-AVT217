<ol><a href = "page3.html">He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest
peg, and “Dwalin at your service!” he said with
a low bow.</a></ol>
<ol>“Bilbo Baggins at yours!” said the hobbit,
too surprised to ask any questions for the
moment. When the silence that followed had
become uncomfortable, he added: “I am just
about to take tea; pray come and have some
with me.” A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it
kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited
dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall
without a word of explanation?</ol>
<ol>They had not been at table long, in fact they
had hardly reached the third cake, when there
came another even louder ring at the bell.
“Excuse me!” said the hobbit, and off he
went to the door</ol>
<ol>“So you have got here at last!” That was
what he was going to say to Gandalf this time.
But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very
old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard
and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside
as soon as the door was open, just as if he had
been invited.</ol>
<ol>“I see they have begun to arrive already,” he
said when he caught sight of Dwalin’s green
hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it,
and “Balin at your service!” he said with his
hand on his breast.</ol>
<ol>“Thank you!” said Bilbo with a gasp. It was
not the correct thing to say, but they have
begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He
liked visitors, but he liked to know them before
they arrived, and he preferred to ask them
himself. He had a horrible thought that the
cakes might run short, and then he—as the
host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however
painful—he might have to go without.</ol>
<ol>“Come along in, and have some tea!” he
managed to say after taking a deep breath.</ol>
<ol>“A little beer would suit me better, if it is all
the same to you, my good sir,” said Balin with
the white beard. “But I don’t mind some cake—
seed-cake, if you have any.”</ol>
<ol>“Lots!” Bilbo found himself answering, to his
own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off,
too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and then
to a pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-
cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his
after-supper morsel.</ol>
<ol>When he got back Balin and Dwalin were
talking at the table like old friends (as a matter
of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down
the beer and the cake in front of them, when
loud came a ring at the bell again, and then
another ring.</ol>
<ol>“Gandalf for certain this time,” he thought as
he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It
was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods,
silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of
them carried a bag of tools and a spade. <a href = "page5.html">In they
hopped, as soon as the door began to open—
Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.</a></ol>
